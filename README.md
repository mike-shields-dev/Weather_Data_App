# Mountain Search and Rescue Weather Data App
#### Author: Michael Shields

## Introduction

This Application is the result of interpreting the assessment brief provided in the HND in Computing | Programming Module Assessments 1 & 2:

### Assessment Brief  

As a computer programmer in a local design studio, you are part of a team that is developing an application for Mountain Rescue England and Wales. This application needs to share weather information on specific locations by collecting user data.  

Mountain Rescue hope the app. will provide the latest and most accurate information for users; reducing accidents and callouts.  

You are to write a program/source-code for an algorithm which could be used in development of the above application using appropriate tools from an IDE. For example, the app may need to sort sets of data. 

Ensure you evaluate the source- code; consider the debugging facilities that are available in your IDE and how any issues identified will be rectified. Your application needs to be as robust and secure as possible. 

## Instructions

In order to run this application, you will need the Python Interpreter Installed on your machine. You can find out how to do that [here](https://www.python.org/)

- Once you have the Python interpreter installed, navigate your CLI to the parent directory of this file.
- To make sure that you have all of the required Python modules (libraries) installed, type the following command into your CLI and hit Enter:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
_This above command will instruct [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (Python's Package Manager) to install the Python modules listed in `requirements.txt` onto your machine. This step is important as these modules are necessary for the application to run!!_ 
- Once you have installed the required modules, you can go ahead and run the application with the command:
```
    python main.py
```
