### Assessment Brief  

As a computer programmer in a local design studio, you are part of a team that is developing an application for Mountain Rescue England and Wales. This application needs to share weather information on specific locations by collecting user data.  

Mountain Rescue hopes the app. will provide the latest and most accurate information for users; reducing accidents and call-outs.  

You are to write a program/source code for an algorithm that could be used in the development of the above application using appropriate tools from an IDE. For example, the app may need to sort sets of data. 

Ensure you evaluate the source code; consider the debugging facilities that are available in your IDE and how any issues identified will be rectified. Your application needs to be as robust and secure as possible.
